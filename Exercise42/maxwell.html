                <img id="img_1"src="images/m20.jpg" alt="Messier Marathon"/>
                <p>
                    It's time for the annual <span id="bold">Messier Marathon</span>. Instead of lacing up their Nikes, amateur astronomers 
                    will be hauling telescopes, star charts, and a hefty pot of coffee in an all-night vigil hunting the Messier objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span id="bold">Messier objects</span> are stellar objects, classified by astronomer <span id="bold">Charles Messier</span> in the 18th century, 
                    ranging from distant galaxies to star clusters to stellar nebula. Now is the only time of the year in 
                    which all 110 Messier objects are in the sky. Unfortunately, if you want to see all of them, you have 
                    to start looking right after sunset and continue until just before sunrise—hence the term, "marathon."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ironically, Charles Messier wasn't all that interested in his objects. He made the list in order to 
                    avoid seeing them. Messier was more interested in discovering new comets, and these beautiful stellar 
                    objects kept getting in the way.
